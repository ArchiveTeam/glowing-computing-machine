The Debian package of propellor ships its full source code because
propellor is configured by rebuilding it, and embraces modification of any
of the source code.

/usr/bin/propellor is a wrapper which will set up a propellor git
repository in ~/.propellor/, and run ~/.propellor/propellor if it exists.
Edit ~/.propellor/config.hs to configure it.
