propellor (0.5.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * A bug that caused propellor to hang when updating a running docker
    container appears to have been fixed. Note that since it affects
    the propellor process that serves as "init" of docker containers,
    they have to be restarted for the fix to take effect.
  * Licence changed from GPL to BSD.
  * A few changes to allow building Propellor on OSX. One user reports
    successfully using it there.

propellor (0.5.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Primary DNS servers now have allow-transfer automatically populated
    with the IP addresses of secondary dns servers. So, it's important
    that all secondary DNS servers have an ipv4 (and/or ipv6) property
    configured.
  * Deal with old ssh connection caching sockets.
  * Add missing build deps and deps. Closes: #745459

propellor (0.5.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Removed root domain records from SOA. Instead, use RootDomain
    when calling Dns.primary.
  * Dns primary and secondary properties are now revertable.
  * When unattendedUpgrades is enabled on an Unstable or Testing system,
    configure it to allow the upgrades.
  * New website, https://propellor.branchable.com/

propellor (0.4.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Propellor can configure primary DNS servers, including generating
    zone files, which is done by looking at the properties of hosts
    in a domain.
  * The `cname` property was renamed to `alias` as it does not always
    generate CNAME in the DNS.
  * Constructor of Property has changed (use `property` function instead).
  * All Property combinators now combine together their Attr settings.
    So Attr settings can be made inside a propertyList, for example.
  * Run all cron jobs under chronic from moreutils to avoid unnecessary
    mails.

    instances running at a time.
  * Add support for SSH ed25519 keys.
    (Thanks, Franz Pletz.)

propellor (0.3.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * ipv6to4: Ensure interface is brought up automatically on boot.
  * Enabling unattended upgrades now ensures that cron is installed and
    running to perform them.
  * Properties can be scheduled to only be checked after a given time period.
  * Fix bootstrapping of dependencies.
  * Fix compilation on Debian stable.
  * Include security updates in sources.list for stable and testing.
  * Use ssh connection caching, especially when bootstrapping.
  * Properties now run in a Propellor monad, which provides access to
    attributes of the host.

propellor (0.2.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * docker: Fix laziness bug that caused running containers to be
    unnecessarily stopped and committed.
  * Add locking so only one propellor can run at a time on a host.
  * docker: When running as effective init inside container, wait on zombies.
  * docker: Added support for configuring shared volumes and linked
    containers.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 08 Apr 2014 02:07:37 -0400

propellor (0.2.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Now supports provisioning docker containers with architecture/libraries
    that do not match the host.
  * Fixed a bug that caused file modes to be set to 600 when propellor
    modified the file (did not affect newly created files).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 04 Apr 2014 01:07:32 -0400

propellor (0.2.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * First release with Debian package.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 03 Apr 2014 01:43:14 -0400

propellor (0.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for provisioning Docker containers.
  * Bootstrap deployment now pushes the git repo to the remote host
    over ssh, securely.
  * propellor --add-key configures a gpg key, and makes propellor refuse
    to pull commits from git repositories not signed with that key.
    This allows propellor to be securely used with public, non-encrypted
    git repositories without the possibility of MITM.
  * Added support for type-safe reversions. Only some properties can be
    reverted; the type checker will tell you if you try something that won't
    work.
  * New syntactic sugar for building a list of properties, including
    revertable properties.
