propellor (3.2.4) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * GHC's fileSystemEncoding is used for all String IO, to avoid
    encoding-related crashes in eg, Propellor.Property.File.
  * Add --build option to simply build config.hs.
  * More informative usage message. Thanks, Daniel Brooks
  * Tor.hiddenService' added to support multiple ports.
    Thanks, Félix Sipma.
  * Apt.noPDiffs added.
    Thanks, Sean Whitton.
  * stack.yaml: Compile with GHC 8.0.1 against lts-7.16.
    Thanks, Andrew Cowie.
  * Added Propellor.Property.File.configFileName and related functions
    to generate good filenames for config directories.

propellor (3.2.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Improve extraction of gpg secret key id list, to work with gpg 2.1.
  * The propellor wrapper checks if ./config.hs exists; if so it runs
    using the configuration in the current directory, rather than
    ~/.propellor/config.hs
  * Debootstap: Fix too tight permissions lock down of debootstrapped
    chroots, which prevented non-root users from doing anything in the
    chroot.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue, 22 Nov 2016 11:36:18 -0400

propellor (3.2.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added Linode.serialGrub property.
  * Clean up build warnings about redundant constraints when built with ghc 8.0.

propellor (3.2.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Sean Whitton ]
  * Using ccache with Sbuild.built & Sbuild.builtFor is now toggleable: these
    properties now take a parameter of type Sbuild.UseCcache.  (API Change)
  * Sbuild.piupartsConf: no longer takes an Apt.Url. (API Change)
  * Sbuild.piupartsConf & Sbuild.piupartsConfFor: does nothing if corresponding
    schroot not built.
    Previously, these properties built the schroot if it was missing.
  * Sbuild.built & Sbuild.piupartsConf: add an additional alias to sid chroots.
    This is for compatibility with `dgit sbuild`.
  * Further improvements to Sbuild.hs haddock.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Tor.hiddenService: Converted port parameter from Int to Port. (API change)
  * Tor.hiddenServiceAvailable: The hidden service hostname file may not
    be available immedaitely after configuring tor; avoid ugly error in
    this case.

propellor (3.1.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Ssh.knownHost: Bug fix: Only fix up the owner of the known_hosts
    file after it exists.

  [ Sean Whitton ]
  * Sbuild.keypairInsecurelyGenerated: Improved to be more robust.
  * Pass --allow-unrelated-histories to git merge when run with git 2.9 or
    newer. This fixes the /usr/bin/propellor wrapper with this version of git.
  * Sbuild.built & Sbuild.builtFor no longer require Sbuild.keypairGenerated.
    Transition guide: If you are using sbuild 0.70.0 or newer, you should
    `rm -r /var/lib/sbuild/apt-keys`.  Otherwise, you should add either
    Sbuild.keypairGenerated or Sbuild.keypairInsecurelyGenerated to your host.
  * Sbuild haddock improvements:
    - State that we don't support squeeze and Buntish older than trusty.
      This is due to our enhancements, such as eatmydata.
    - State that you need sbuild 0.70.0 or newer to build for stretch.
      This is due to gpg2 hitting Debian stretch.
    - Explain when a keygen is required.
    - Update sample ~/.sbuildrc for sbuild 0.71.0.
    - Add hint for customising chroots with propellor.
    - Update example usage of System type.

propellor (3.1.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Architecture changed from String to an ADT. (API Change)
    Transition guide: Change "amd64" to X86_64, "i386" to X86_32,
    "armel" to ARMEL, etc.
    Thanks, Félix Sipma.
  * The Debian data type now includes a DebianKernel. (API Change)
    This won't affect most config.hs, as osDebian defaults to
    Linux. Added osDebian' can be used to specify a different kernel.
    Thanks, Félix Sipma.
  * Improve exception handling. A property that threw a non-IOException
    used to stop the whole propellor run. Now, all non-async exceptions
    only make the property that threw them fail. (Implicit API change)
  * Added StopPropellorException and stopPropellorMessage which can be
    used in the unusual case where a failure of one property should stop
    propellor from trying to ensure any other properties.
  * tryPropellor returns Either SomeException instead of Either IOException
    (API change)
  * Switch letsencrypt to certbot package name.
  * Sbuild: Add keyringInsecurelyGenerated which is useful on throwaway
    build VMs.
    Thanks, Sean Whitton
  * Added Propellor.Property.SiteSpecific.Exoscale.
    Thanks, Sean Whitton
  * Property.Reboot: Added toDistroKernel and toKernelNewerThan.
    Thanks, Sean Whitton
  * Added ConfFile.hasIniSection.
    Thanks, Félix Sipma.
  * Apt.install: When asked to install a package that apt does not know
    about, it used to incorrectly succeed. Now it will fail.
  * Property.Firejail: New module.
    Thanks, Sean Whitton
  * File: Write privdata files in binary rather than text, which avoids
    failure when they do not contain valid unicode.
    Thanks, Andrew Schurman
  * Generalized fileProperty can now operate on a file as either a series
    of lines, or a ByteString.

  [ Sean Whitton ]
  * New info property Schroot.useOverlays to indicate whether you want schroots
    set up by propellor to use the Linux kernel's OverlayFS.
  * Schroot.overlaysInTmpfs sets Schroot.useOverlays info property.
  * If you have indicated that you want schroots to use OverlayFS and the
    current kernel does not support it, Sbuild.built will attempt to reboot
    into a kernel that does, or fail if it can't find one.
  * Sbuild.built will no longer add duplicate `aliases=UNRELEASED,sid...` lines
    to more than one schroot config. It will not remove any such lines that the
    previous version of propellor added, though.
  * Sbuild.keypairGenerated works around Debian bug #792100 by creating the
    directory /root/.gnupg in advance.
  * Ccache.hasCache now sets the setgid bit on the cache directory, as 
    ccache requires.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Wed, 22 Jun 2016 15:29:27 -0400

propellor (3.0.5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Modules added for Sbuild and Ccache.
    Thanks, Sean Whitton
  * Systemd: Added killUserProcesses property, which can be reverted
    to return systemd to its default behavior before version 230 started
    killing processes like screen sessions.
  * Systemd: Added logindConfigured property.

  * Fix build with directory-1.2.6.2.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sun, 22 May 2016 15:54:49 -0400

propellor (3.0.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Remove Propellor.DotDir from the propellor library, as its use of
    Paths_propellor prevents use of the module out of propellor's tree.
    This module is only needed for the wrapper program anyway, which
    handles --init.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sun, 01 May 2016 17:51:37 -0400

propellor (3.0.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * propellor --init now runs cabal sandbox init if cabal has been
    configured with require-sandbox: True.
    Thanks, Sean Whitton
  * Re-bundled concurrent-output so propellor can be deployed to Debian
    stable systems without installing it (insecurely) from hackage.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue, 05 Apr 2016 13:35:54 -0400

propellor (3.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Property types have been improved to indicate what systems they target.
    This prevents using eg, Property FreeBSD on a Debian system.
    Transition guide for this sweeping API change:
    - First, upgrade to propellor 2.17.2 and deploy that to all your hosts.
      Otherwise, propellor --spin will fail when you upgrade to
      propellor 3.0.0.
    - Change "host name & foo & bar"
      to     "host name $ props & foo & bar"
    - Similarly, `propertyList` and `combineProperties` need `props`
      to be used to combine together properties; they no longer accept
      lists of properties. (If you have such a list, use `toProps`.)
    - And similarly, Chroot, Docker, and Systemd container need `props`
      to be used to combine together the properies used inside them.
    - The `os` property is removed. Instead use `osDebian`, `osBuntish`,
      or `osFreeBSD`. These tell the type checker the target OS of a host.
    - Change "Property NoInfo" to "Property UnixLike"
    - Change "Property HasInfo" to "Property (HasInfo + UnixLike)"
    - Change "RevertableProperty NoInfo" to
      "RevertableProperty UnixLike UnixLike"
    - Change "RevertableProperty HasInfo" to
      "RevertableProperty (HasInfo + UnixLike) UnixLike"
    - GHC needs {-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-} to use these fancy types.
      This is enabled by default for all modules in propellor.cabal. But
      if you are using propellor as a library, you may need to enable it
      manually.
    - If you know a property only works on a particular OS, like Debian
      or FreeBSD, use that instead of "UnixLike". For example:
      "Property Debian"
    - It's also possible make a property support a set of OS's, for example:
      "Property (Debian + FreeBSD)"
    - Removed `infoProperty` and `simpleProperty` constructors, instead use
      `property` to construct a Property.
    - Due to the polymorphic type returned by `property`, additional type
      signatures tend to be needed when using it. For example, this will
      fail to type check, because the type checker cannot guess what type
      you intend the intermediate property "go" to have:
        foo :: Property UnixLike
        foo = go `requires` bar
 	  where
 		go = property "foo" (return NoChange)
      To fix, specify the type of go:
 	  	go :: Property UnixLike
    - `ensureProperty` now needs to be passed a witness to the type of the 
      property it's used in.
      change this:  foo = property desc $ ... ensureProperty bar
      to this:      foo = property' desc $ \w -> ... ensureProperty w bar
    - General purpose properties like cmdProperty have type "Property UnixLike".
      When using that to run a command only available on Debian, you can
      tighten the type to only the OS that your more specific property works on.
      For example:
        upgraded :: Property Debian
        upgraded = tightenTargets (cmdProperty "apt-get" ["upgrade"])
    - Several utility functions have been renamed:
      getInfo to fromInfo
      propertyInfo to getInfo
      propertyDesc to getDesc
      propertyChildren to getChildren
  * The new `pickOS` property combinator can be used to combine different
    properties, supporting different OS's, into one Property that chooses
    which to use based on the Host's OS.
  * Re-enabled -O0 in propellor.cabal to reign in ghc's memory use handling
    these complex new types.
  * Added dependency on concurrent-output; removed embedded copy.
  * Apt.PPA: New module, contributed by Evan Cofsky.
  * Improved propellor's first run experience; propellor --init will
    walk the user through setting up ~/.propellor, with a choice between
    a clone of propellor's git repository, or a minimal config, and will
    configure propellor to use a gpg key.
  * Stack support. "git config propellor.buildsystem stack" will make
    propellor build its config using stack.
  * When propellor is installed using stack, propellor --init will
    automatically set propellor.buildsystem=stack.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sat, 02 Apr 2016 15:33:26 -0400

propellor (2.17.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * When new dependencies are added to propellor or the propellor config,
    try harder to get them installed. In particular, this makes 
    propellor --spin work when the remote host needs to get dependencies
    installed in order to build the updated config.
  * Apt.update: Also run dpkg --configure -a here as apt for some reason
    won't even update if dpkg was interrupted.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Wed, 30 Mar 2016 15:45:08 -0400

propellor (2.17.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Avoid generating excessively long paths to the unix socket file
    used for ssh connection caching. Mostly. Can still generate a too long
    one if $HOME is longer than 60 bytes.
  * Uwsgi: add ".ini" extension to app config files. 
    Files without extensions were ignored by uwsgi.
    Thanks, Félix Sipma.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Mon, 28 Mar 2016 11:06:34 -0400

propellor (2.17.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added initial support for FreeBSD.
    Thanks, Evan Cofsky.

    Thanks, Evan Cofsky.
  * Firewall: Reorganized Chain data type. (API change)
    Thanks, Félix Sipma.
  * Firewall: Separated Table and Target (API change)
    Thanks, Félix Sipma.
  * Ssh: change type of listenPort from Int to Port (API change)
    Thanks, Félix Sipma.
  * Firewall: add TCPFlag, Frequency, TCPSyn, ICMPTypeMatch, NatDestination
    Thanks, Félix Sipma.
  * Network: Filter out characters not allowed in interfaces.d files.
    Thanks, Félix Sipma.
  * Apt.upgrade: Run dpkg --configure -a first, to recover from
    interrupted upgrades.
  * Apt: Add safeupgrade.
  * Force ssh, scp, and git commands to be run in the foreground.
    Should fix intermittent hangs of propellor --spin.
  * Avoid repeated re-building on systems such as FreeBSD where building
    re-links the binary even when there are no changes.
  * Locale.available: Run locale-gen, instead of dpkg-reconfigure locales,
    which modified the locale.gen file and sometimes caused the property to
    need to make changes every time.
  * Speed up propellor's build of itself, by asking cabal to only build
    the propellor-config binary and not all the libraries.
  * Tor.named: Fix bug that sometimes caused the property to fail the first
    time, though retrying succeeded.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Thu, 24 Mar 2016 14:53:31 -0400

propellor (2.16.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Obnam: Only let one backup job run at a time when a host has multiple
    different backup properties, to avoid concurrent jobs fighting over
    scarce resources (particularly memory). Other jobs block on a lock
    file.
  * Removed references to a Debian derivative from code and documentation
    because of an unfortunate trademark use policy.
    http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/trademark_nonsense/
  * That included changing a data constructor to "Buntish", an API change.
  * Firewall.rule: Now takes a Table parameter. (API change)
  * Firewall: add InIFace/OutIFace Rules, add Source/Destination Rules,
    add CustomTarget, and more improvements.
    Thanks, Félix Sipma.
  * Ssh.authorizedKey: Fix bug preventing it from working when the
    authorized_keys file does not yet exist.
  * Removed Ssh.unauthorizedKey and made Ssh.authorizedKey revertable.
    (API change)

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sat, 27 Feb 2016 13:31:57 -0400

propellor (2.15.4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Build /usr/src/propellor/propellor.git reproducibly,
    which makes the whole Debian package build reproducibly.
    Thanks, Sean Whitton.
  * Obnam: To cause old generations to be forgotten, keepParam can be
    passed to a backup property; this causes obnam forget to be run.
  * Delete /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades.ucf-dist when
    unattended-upgrades is installed, to work around #812380 which results
    in many warnings from apt, including in cron mails.
  * Added Propellor.Property.LetsEncrypt
  * Apache.httpsVirtualHost: New property, setting up a https vhost
    with the certificate automatically obtained using letsencrypt.
  * Allow using combineProperties and propertyList with lists of
    RevertableProperty.

propellor (2.15.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added GNUPGBIN environment variable or git.program git config
    to control the command run for gpg. Allows eg, GNUPGBIN=gpg2
    Thanks, Félix Sipma.
  * Bootstrap apt-get installs run with deconf noninteractive frontend.
  * spin --via: Avoid committing on relay host.
  * Postfix: Add service property to enable/disable services in master.cf.
  * Added Munin module, contributed by Jelmer Vernooij.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sun, 03 Jan 2016 16:56:26 -0400

propellor (2.15.1) unstable; urgency=medium

    Thanks, Sean Whitton.
  * Added User.systemAccountFor and User.systemAccountFor' properties.

  * Gpg.keyImported converted to not use a flag file and instead check
    if gpg has the provided key already.
    Thanks, Félix Sipma.
  * Clean build with ghc 7.10.
  * Merged Utility changes from git-annex.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sat, 19 Dec 2015 16:43:09 -0400

propellor (2.15.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added UncheckedProperty type, along with unchecked to indicate a
    Property needs its result checked, and checkResult and changesFile
    to check for changes.
  * Properties that run an arbitrary command, such as cmdProperty
    and scriptProperty are converted to use UncheckedProperty, since
    they cannot tell on their own if the command truely made a change or not.
    (API Change)
    Transition guide:
    - When GHC complains about an UncheckedProperty, add:
    	`assume` MadeChange
      (Since these properties used to always return MadeChange, that
      change is always safe to make.)
    - Or, if you know that the command should modifiy a file, use:
    	`changesFile` filename
  * The `trivial` combinator has been removed. (API change)
    Instead, use:
    	`assume` NoChange
    Or, better, use changesFile or checkResult to accurately report
    when a property makes a change.
  * A few properties have had their Result improved, for example
    Apt.buldDep and Apt.autoRemove now check if a change was made or not.
  * User.hasDesktopGroups changed to avoid trying to add the user to
    groups that don't exist.
  * Added Postfix.saslPasswdSet.
  * Added Propellor.Property.Locale.
    Thanks, Sean Whitton.
  * Added Propellor.Property.Fail2Ban.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sun, 06 Dec 2015 15:33:51 -0400

  * DiskImage creation automatically uses Chroot.noServices.
  * Removed the (unused) dependency on quickcheck.
  * DebianMirror: Added a DebianMirror type for configuration (API change)
    Thanks, Félix Sipma.
  * DebianMirror: Add RsyncExtra to configuration.

propellor (2.13.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * RevertableProperty used to be assumed to contain info, but this is
    now made explicit, with RevertableProperty HasInfo or
    RevertableProperty NoInfo. (API change)
    Transition guide:
      - If you define a RevertableProperty, expect some type check
        failures like: "Expecting one more argument to ‘RevertableProperty’".
      - Change it to "RevertableProperty NoInfo"
      - The compiler will then tell you if it needs "HasInfo" instead.
      - If you have code that uses the RevertableProperty constructor
        that fails to type check, use the more powerful <!> operator
        instead to create the RevertableProperty.
  * Various property combinators that combined a RevertableProperty
    with a non-revertable property used to yield a RevertableProperty.
    This was a bug, because the combined property could not be fully
    reverted in many cases, and the result is now a non-revertable property.
  * combineWith now takes an additional parameter to control how revert
    actions are combined (API change).
  * Added Propellor.Property.Concurrent for concurrent properties.
  * Made the execProcess exported by propellor, and everything built on it,
    avoid scrambled output when run concurrently.
  * Propellor now depends on STM and text.
  * The cabal file now builds propellor with -O. While -O0 makes ghc
    take less memory while building propellor, it can lead to bad memory
    usage at runtime due to eg, disabled stream fusion.
  * Add File.isCopyOf. Thanks, Per Olofsson.

  * HostName: Improve domain extraction code.
  * Added Mount.fstabbed property to generate /etc/fstab to replicate
    current mounts.
  * HostName: Improve domain extraction code.
  * Add File.basedOn. Thanks, Per Olofsson.
  * Changed how the operating system is provided to Chroot (API change).
    Where before debootstrapped and bootstrapped took a System parameter,
    the os property should now be added to the Chroot.
  * Follow-on change to Systemd.container, which now takes a System parameter.
  * Generalized Property.check so it can be used with Propellor actions as
    well as IO actions.
  * Hostname.sane and Hostname.setTo can now safely be used as a property
    of a chroot, and won't affect the hostname of the host system.

    file content via origfile.propellor-new~, instead of to a randomly named
    temp file. This allows them to clean up any temp file that may have
    been left by an interrupted run of propellor.
  * Added Propellor.Property.Spin, which can be used to make a host be a
    controller of other hosts, which will automatically spin them each time
    propellor is run.
  * Ssh.keyImported is replaced with Ssh.userKeys. (API change)
    The new property only gets the private key from the privdata; the
    public key is provided as a parameter, and so is available as
    Info that other properties can use.
  * Ssh.keyImported' is renamed to Ssh.userKeyAt, and also changed
    to only import the private key from the privdata. (API change)
  * While Ssh.keyImported and Ssh.keyImported' avoided updating existing
    keys, the new Ssh.userKeys and Ssh.userKeyAt properties will
    always update out of date key files.
  * Ssh.pubKey renamed to Ssh.hostPubKey. (API change)
  * Added --unset-unused 
  * Fix typo: propigate → propagate. Thanks, Felix Gruber.
    (A minor API change)
  * Chroot: Converted to use a ChrootBootstrapper type class, so
    other ways to bootstrap chroots can easily be added in separate
    modules. (API change)

propellor (2.8.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Guard against power loss etc when building propellor, by updating
    the executable atomically.
  * Added Logcheck module, contributed by Jelmer Vernooij.
  * Added Kerberos module, contributed by Jelmer Vernooij.
  * Privdata that uses HostContext inside a container will now have the
    name of the container as its context, rather than the name of
    the host(s) where the container is used. This allows eg, having different
    passwords for a user in different containers. Note that previously,
    propellor would prompt using the container name as the context, but
    not actually use privdata using that context; so this is a bug fix.
  * Fix --add-key to not fail committing when no privdata file exists yet.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sun, 04 Oct 2015 13:54:59 -0400

propellor (2.8.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added Propellor.Property.Rsync.
  * Convert Info to use Data.Dynamic, so properties can export and consume
    info of any type that is Typeable and a Monoid, including data types
    private to a module. (API change)
    Thanks to Joachim Breitner for the idea.
  * Improve propellor wrapper to better handle installation cloning
    the public propellor repo, by setting that repo to be upstream,
    so propellor doesnt try to push to a read-only repo.
  * Added DebianMirror module, contributed by Félix Sipma.
  * Some hlint cleanups.
    Thanks, Mario Lang
  * Added Propellor.Property.Unbound for the caching DNS server.
    Thanks, Félix Sipma.
  * Added PTR to Dns.Record. While this is ignored by
    Propellor.Property.Dns for now, since reverse DNS setup is not
    implemented there yet, it can be used in other places, eg Unbound.
    Thanks, Félix Sipma.
  * PrivData converted to newtype (API change).
  * Stopped stripping trailing newlines when setting PrivData;
    this was previously done to avoid mistakes when pasting eg passwords
    with an unwanted newline. Instead, PrivData consumers should use either
    privDataLines or privDataVal, to extract respectively lines or a
    value (without internal newlines) from PrivData.
  * Allow storing arbitrary ByteStrings in PrivData, extracted using
    privDataByteString.
  * Added Aiccu module, contributed by Jelmer Vernooĳ.
  * Added --rm-key.

    files, and generic support for files containing some sort of sections.
    Thanks, Sean Whitton for completing the implementation.
  * Added Propellor.Property.LightDM
    Thanks, Sean Whitton.
  * Multiple Tor.hiddenService properties can now be defined for a host;
    previously only one such property worked per host.

    and ForcedCommandsOnly (API change)
  * setSshdConfig type changed, and setSshdConfigBool added with old type.
  * Fix a bug in shim generation code for docker and chroots, that
    sometimes prevented deployment of docker containers.
  * Added onChangeFlagOnFail which is often a safer alternative to
    onChange.
    Thanks, Antoine Eiche.
  * Work around broken git pull option parser in git 2.5.0,
    which broke use of --upload-pack to send a git push when running
    propellor --spin.

  * Replace String type synonym Docker.Image by a data type
    which allows to specify an image name and an optional tag. (API change)
    Thanks, Antoine Eiche.

  * cmdProperty' renamed to cmdPropertyEnv to make way for a new,
    more generic cmdProperty' (API change)
  * Add docker image related properties.
    Thanks, Antoine Eiche.
  * Export CommandParam, boolSystem, safeSystem, shellEscape, and
    createProcess from Propellor.Property.Cmd, so they are available
    for use in constricting your own Properties when using propellor
    as a library.
  * Improve enter-machine scripts for systemd-nspawn containers to unset most
    environment variables.
  * Fix Postfix.satellite bug; the default relayhost was set to the
    domain, not to smtp.domain as documented.
  * Mount /proc inside a chroot before provisioning it, to work around #787227
  * --spin now works when given a short hostname that only resolves to an
    ipv6 address.
  * Added publish property for systemd-spawn containers, for port publishing.
    (Needs systemd version 220.)
  * Added bind and bindRo properties for systemd-spawn containers.
  * Firewall: Port was changed to a newtype, and the Port and PortRange
    constructors of Rules were changed to DPort and DportRange, respectively.
    (API change)
  * Docker: volume and publish accept Bound FilePath and Bound Port,
    respectively. They also continue to accept Strings, for backwards
    compatibility.
  * Docker: Added environment property.
    Thanks Antoine Eiche.

propellor (2.4.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Propellor no longer supports Debian wheezy (oldstable).
  * Git.bareRepo: Fix bug in calls to userScriptProperty.
    Thanks, Jelmer Vernooij.
  * Removed Obnam.latestVersion which was only needed for Debian wheezy
    backport.
  * Merged Utility changes from git-annex.
  * Switched from MonadCatchIO-transformers to the newer transformers and
    exceptions libraries.
  * Ensure build deps are installed before building propellor in --spin
    and cron job, even if propellor was already built before, to deal with
    upgrades that add new dependencies.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Wed, 06 May 2015 14:28:59 -0400

propellor (2.3.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Make propellor resistent to changes to shared libraries, such as libffi,
    which might render the propellor binary unable to run. This is dealt with
    by checking the binary both when running propellor on a remote host,
    and by Cron.runPropellor. If the binary doesn't work, it will be rebuilt.
  * Note that since a new switch had to be added to allow testing the binary,
    upgrading to this version will cause a rebuild from scratch of propellor.
  * Added hasLoginShell and shellEnabled.
  * debCdn changed to new httpredir.debian.org official replacement for
    http.debian.net.
  * API change: Added User and Group newtypes, and Properties that
    used to use the type UserName = String were changed to use them.

propellor (2.2.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * When running shimmed (eg in a docker container),
    improve process name visible in ps.
  * Add shebang to cron.daily etc files. 
  * Some changes to tor configuration, minor API change.
  * Propellor now builds itself, and gets its build dependencies installed
    when deploying to a new host, without needing the Makefile.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Mon, 09 Mar 2015 12:02:31 -0400

propellor (2.1.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Additional tor properties, including support for making relays, 
    and naming bridges, relays, etc.
  * New Cron.Times data type, which allows Cron.job to install
    daily/monthly/weekly jobs that anacron can run. (API change)
  * Fix Git.daemonRunning to restart inetd after enabling the git server.
  * Ssh.authorizedKey: Make the authorized_keys file and .ssh directory
    be owned by the user, not root.
  * Ssh.knownHost: Make the .ssh directory be owned by the user, not root.

propellor (2.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Property has been converted to a GADT, and will be Property NoInfo
    or Property HasInfo.
    This was done to make sure that ensureProperty is only used on
    properties that do not have Info.
    Transition guide:
    - Change all "Property" to "Property NoInfo" or "Property HasInfo"
      (The compiler can tell you if you got it wrong!)
    - To construct a RevertableProperty, it is useful to use the new
      (<!>) operator
    - Constructing a list of properties can be problimatic, since
      Property NoInto and Property HasInfo are different types and cannot
      appear in the same list. To deal with this, "props" has been added,
      and can built up a list of properties of different types,
      using the same (&) and (!) operators that are used to build
      up a host's properties.
  * Add descriptions of how to set missing fields to --list-fields output.
  * Properties now form a tree, instead of the flat list used before.
    This includes the properties used inside a container.
  * Fix info propagation from fallback combinator's second Property.
  * Added systemd configuration properties.
  * Added journald configuration properties.
  * Added more network interface configuration properties.
  * Implemented OS.preserveNetwork.

propellor (1.3.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * --spin checks if the DNS matches any configured IP address property
    of the host, and if not, sshes to the host by IP address.
  * Detect #774376 and refuse to use docker if the system is so broken
    that docker exec doesn't enter a chroot.
  * Update intermediary propellor in --spin --via
  * Added support for DNSSEC.
  * Ssh.hostKey and Ssh.hostKeys no longer install public keys from
    the privdata. Instead, the public keys are included in the
    configuration. (API change)
  * Ssh.hostKeys now removes any host keys of types that the host is not
    configured to have.
  * sshPubKey is renamed to Ssh.pubKey, and has an added SshKeyType
    parameter. (API change)
  * CloudAtCost.deCruft no longer forces randomHostKeys.
  * Fix build with process 1.2.1.0.

propellor (1.2.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added CryptPassword to PrivDataField, for password hashes as produced

propellor (1.1.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * --spin target --via relay causes propellor to bounce through an
    intermediate relay host, which handles any necessary uploads
    when provisioning the target host.
  * --spin can be passed multiple hosts, and it will provision each host
    in turn.
  * Add --merge, to combine multiple --spin commits into a single, more useful
    commit.
  * Hostname parameters not containing dots are looked up in the DNS to
    find the full hostname.
  * propellor --spin can now deploy propellor to hosts that do not have 
    git, ghc, or apt-get. This is accomplished by uploading a fairly
    portable precompiled tarball of propellor.
  * Propellor.Property.OS contains properties that can be used to do a clean
    reinstall of the OS of an existing host. This can be used, for example,
    to do an in-place conversion from Fedora to Debian.
    This is experimental; use with caution!
  * Added group-related properties. Thanks, Félix Sipma.
  * Added Git.barerepo. Thanks, Félix Sipma.
  * Added Grub.installed and Grub.boots properties.
  * New HostContext can be specified when a PrivData value varies per host.
  * hasSomePassword and hasPassword now default to using HostContext.
    To specify a different context, use hasSomePassword' and
    hasPassword' (API change)
  * hasSomePassword and hasPassword now make sure shadow passwords are enabled.
  * cron.runPropellor now runs propellor, rather than using its Makefile.
    This is more robust.
  * propellor.debug can be set in the git config to enable more persistent
    debugging output.
  * Run apt-cache policy with LANG=C so it works on other locales.
  * endAction can be used to register an action to run once propellor
    has successfully run on a host.

propellor (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * propellor --spin can now be used to update remote hosts, without
    any central git repository needed. The central git repository is
    still useful for running propellor from cron, but this simplifies
    getting started with propellor, and allows for more ad-hoc usage.
  * The git repo url, if any, is updated whenever propellor --spin is used.
  * Added prosody module, contributed by Félix Sipma.
  * Can be used to configure tor hidden services. Thanks, Félix Sipma.
  * When multiple gpg keys are added, ensure that the privdata file
    can be decrypted by all of them.
  * Convert GpgKeyId to newtype. (API change)
  * DigitalOcean.distroKernel property now reboots into the distribution
    kernel when necessary.
  * Avoid outputting color setting sequences when not run on a terminal.
  * Docker code simplified by using `docker exec`; needs docker 1.3.1.
  * Docker containers are now a separate data type, cannot be included
    in the main host list, and are instead passed to
    Docker.docked. (API change)
  * Added support for using debootstrap from propellor.
  * Propellor can now be used to provision chroots.
  * systemd-nspawn containers can now be managed by propellor, very similar
    to its handling of docker containers.
  * Debian package will be maintained by Gergely Nagy.

  * Fix loop when a docker host that does not exist was docked.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Oct 2014 09:57:31 -0400

propellor (0.9.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Avoid encoding the current stable suite in propellor's code,
    since that poses a difficult transition around the release,
    and can easily be wrong if an older version of propellor is used.
    Instead, the os property for a stable system includes the suite name
    to use, eg Stable "wheezy".
  * stdSourcesList uses the stable suite name, to avoid unwanted
    immediate upgrades to the next stable release. (API change)
  * debCdn switched from cdn.debian.net to http.debian.net, which seems to be
    better managed now.
  * Docker: Avoid committing container every time it's started up.

propellor (0.8.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The Debian package now includes a single-revision git repository in
    /usr/src/propellor/, and ~/.propellor/ is set up to use this repository as
    its origin remote. This avoids relying on the security of the github
    repository when using the Debian package.
  * The /usr/bin/propellor wrapper will warn when ~/.propellor/ is out of date
    and a newer version is available, after which git merge upstream/master
    can be run to merge it.
  * Included the config.hs symlink to config-simple.hs in the cabal and Debian

propellor (0.8.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Completely reworked privdata storage. There is now a single file,
    and each host is sent only the privdata that its Properties actually use.

    To transition existing privdata, run propellor against a host and
    watch out for the red failure messages, and run the suggested commands
    to store the privdata using the new storage scheme. You may find
    it useful to run the old version of propellor to extract data from the old
    privdata files during this migration.

    Several properties that use privdata now require a context to be
    specified. If in doubt, you can use anyContext, or
    Context "hostname.example.com"

  * Add --edit to edit a privdata value in $EDITOR.
  * Add --list-fields to list all currently set privdata fields, along with
    the hosts that use them.
  * Fix randomHostKeys property to run openssh-server's postinst in a
    non-failing way.
  * Hostname.sane now cleans up the 127.0.0.1 localhost line in /etc/hosts,
    to avoid eg, apache complaining "Could not reliably determine the
    server's fully qualified domain name".

  * combineProperties no longer stops when a property fails; now it continues
    trying to satisfy all properties on the list before propigating the
    failure.
  * Attr is renamed to Info. (API change)
  * Renamed wrapper to propellor to make cabal installation of propellor work.
  * When git gpg signature of a fetched git branch cannot be verified,
    propellor will now continue running, but without merging in that branch.

propellor (0.6.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Docker containers now propagate DNS attributes out to the host they're
    docked in. So if a docker container sets a DNS alias, every container
    it's docked in will automatically be added to a DNS round-robin,
    when propellor is used to manage DNS for the domain.
  * Apt.stdSourcesList no longer needs a suite to be specified. (API change)
  * Added --dump to dump out a field of a host's privdata. Useful for editing
    it.
  * Propellor's output now includes the hostname being provisioned, or
    when provisioning a docker container, the container name.

propellor (0.5.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * A bug that caused propellor to hang when updating a running docker
    container appears to have been fixed. Note that since it affects
    the propellor process that serves as "init" of docker containers,
    they have to be restarted for the fix to take effect.
  * Licence changed from GPL to BSD.
  * A few changes to allow building Propellor on OSX. One user reports

    in a domain.
  * The `cname` property was renamed to `alias` as it does not always
    generate CNAME in the DNS. (API change)
  * Constructor of Property has changed (use `property` function instead).
    (API change)
  * All Property combinators now combine together their Attr settings.
    So Attr settings can be made inside a propertyList, for example.
  * Run all cron jobs under chronic from moreutils to avoid unnecessary
    mails.

    unnecessarily stopped and committed.

  * docker: When running as effective init inside container, wait on zombies.

propellor (0.2.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Now supports provisioning docker containers with architecture/libraries
    that do not match the host.
  * Fixed a bug that caused file modes to be set to 600 when propellor
    modified the file (did not affect newly created files).

  * First release with Debian package.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 03 Apr 2014 01:43:14 -0400

propellor (0.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for provisioning Docker containers.
  * Bootstrap deployment now pushes the git repo to the remote host
    over ssh, securely.
  * propellor --add-key configures a gpg key, and makes propellor refuse
    to pull commits from git repositories not signed with that key.
    This allows propellor to be securely used with public, non-encrypted
    git repositories without the possibility of MITM.
  * Added support for type-safe reversions. Only some properties can be
    reverted; the type checker will tell you if you try something that won't
    work.
  * New syntactic sugar for building a list of properties, including
    revertable properties.
