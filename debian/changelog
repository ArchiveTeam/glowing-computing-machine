propellor (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for provisioning Docker containers.
  * Bootstrap deployment now pushes the git repo to the remote host
    over ssh, securely.
  * propellor --add-key configures a gpg key, and makes propellor refuse
    to pull commits from git repositories not signed with that key.
    This allows propellor to be securely used with public, non-encrypted
    git repositories without the possibility of MITM.
  * Added support for type-safe reversions. Only some properties can be
    reverted; the type checker will tell you if you try something that won't
    work.
  * New syntactic sugar for building a list of properties, including
    revertable properties.
