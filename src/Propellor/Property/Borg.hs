-- | Installs a cron job that causes a given directory to be backed
-- up, by running borg with some parameters.
--
-- If the directory does not exist, or exists but is completely empty,
-- this Property will immediately restore it from an existing backup.
--
-- So, this property can be used to deploy a directory of content
-- to a host, while also ensuring any changes made to it get backed up.
-- For example:
--
-- >	& Borg.backup "/srv/git" "root@myserver:/mnt/backup/git.borg" Cron.Daily
-- >		["--exclude=/srv/git/tobeignored"]
-- >		[Borg.KeepDays 7, Borg.KeepWeeks 4, Borg.KeepMonths 6, Borg.KeepYears 1]
--
-- Note that this property does not make borg encrypt the backup
-- repository.
--
-- Since borg uses a fair amount of system resources, only one borg
-- backup job will be run at a time. Other jobs will wait their turns to
-- run.
