# FreeBSD Support for Propellor

This branch is to add FreeBSD support to Propellor. The first steps
will focus around package management with pkg-ng.

# Bootstrapping

The current Bootstrap process is very apt-centric, so current efforts
are focusing on passing the System information down into Bootstrap.

Affected functions are:

* `installGitCommand`, which has to install pkg itself, then install
  git. The `ASSUME_ALWAYS_YES` environment variable must be set so pkg
  will just do its thing.

* `depsCommand`, which installs as many Haskell dependencies from the
  system package manager. We also install gmake, but I'm not sure
  where this is used yet.
