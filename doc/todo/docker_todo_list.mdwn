* Display of docker container properties is a bit wonky. It always
  says they are unchanged even when they changed and triggered a
  reprovision.
* There is no way for a property of a docker container to require
  some property be met outside the container. For example, some servers
  need ntp installed for a good date source.
* Docking a container in a host should add to the host any cnames that
  are assigned to the container.
* It seems that provisionContainer sometimes hangs when the container
  is already running. This seems likely to be a problem with the simpleSh
  socket hack.
