* Need a way to run an action when a property changes, but only
  run it once for the whole. For example, may want to restart apache,
  but only once despite many config changes being made to satisfy
  properties. onChange is a poor substitute.a
* Relatedly, a property that say, installs systemd needs to have a way
  to reboot the system when a change is made. But this should only
  happen at the very end, after everything else.
