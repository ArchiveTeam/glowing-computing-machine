* Either `Ssh.hostKey` should set the sshPubKey attr
  (which seems hard, as attrs need to be able to be calculated without
  running any IO code, and here IO is needed along with decrypting the
  PrivData..), or the public key should not be stored in
  the PrivData, and instead configured using the attr.
  Getting the ssh host key into the attr will allow automatically
  exporting it via DNS (SSHFP record)
