Propellor is free software, released under a BSD license. Anyone is free to
modify and distribute it; indeed doing so is a fundamental part of how 
propellor is configured and used.

You don't have to contribute your patches, but you're encouraged to do so;
let's all make propellor awesome together! Patches can be sent to
<propellor@joeyh.name> or pull requests can be posted to [[todo]].

To certify that a change is released under propellor's BSD license,
you can use `git commit --signoff`.

Propellor has its own [[coding_style]], which you are encouraged to follow
-- at least when you want to get a patch merged into propellor. 
When writing code for your own internal use, feel free to ignore all the
rules, except the ones about avoiding partial functions.
