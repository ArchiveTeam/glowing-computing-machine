   * Avoid generating excessively long paths to the unix socket file
     used for ssh connection caching. Mostly. Can still generate a too long
     one if $HOME is longer than 60 bytes.
   * Uwsgi: add ".ini" extension to app config files.
     Files without extensions were ignored by uwsgi.
     Thanks, FÃ©lix Sipma."""]]
