   * Improve extraction of gpg secret key id list, to work with gpg 2.1.
   * The propellor wrapper checks if ./config.hs exists; if so it runs
     using the configuration in the current directory, rather than
     ~/.propellor/config.hs
   * Debootstap: Fix too tight permissions lock down of debootstrapped
     chroots, which prevented non-root users from doing anything in the
     chroot."""]]
