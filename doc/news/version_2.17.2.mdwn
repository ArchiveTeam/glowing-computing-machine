propellor 2.17.2 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * When new dependencies are added to propellor or the propellor config,
     try harder to get them installed. In particular, this makes
     propellor --spin work when the remote host needs to get dependencies
     installed in order to build the updated config.
   * Apt.update: Also run dpkg --configure -a here as apt for some reason
     won't even update if dpkg was interrupted."""]]
