propellor 3.1.2 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
 * [ Joey Hess ]
   * Ssh.knownHost: Bug fix: Only fix up the owner of the known\_hosts
     file after it exists.
 * [ Sean Whitton ]
   * Sbuild.keypairInsecurelyGenerated: Improved to be more robust.
   * Pass --allow-unrelated-histories to git merge when run with git 2.9 or
     newer. This fixes the /usr/bin/propellor wrapper with this version of git.
   * Sbuild.built &amp; Sbuild.builtFor no longer require Sbuild.keypairGenerated.
     Transition guide: If you are using sbuild 0.70.0 or newer, you should
     `rm -r /var/lib/sbuild/apt-keys`.  Otherwise, you should add either
     Sbuild.keypairGenerated or Sbuild.keypairInsecurelyGenerated to your host.
   * Sbuild haddock improvements:
     - State that we don't support squeeze and Buntish older than trusty.
       This is due to our enhancements, such as eatmydata.
     - State that you need sbuild 0.70.0 or newer to build for stretch.
       This is due to gpg2 hitting Debian stretch.
     - Explain when a keygen is required.
     - Update sample ~/.sbuildrc for sbuild 0.71.0.
     - Add hint for customising chroots with propellor.
     - Update example usage of System type."""]]
