propellor 0.6.0 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Docker containers now propagate DNS attributes out to the host they're
     docked in. So if a docker container sets a DNS alias, every container
     it's docked in will automatically be added to a DNS round-robin,
     when propellor is used to manage DNS for the domain.
   * Apt.stdSourcesList no longer needs a suite to be specified.
   * Added --dump to dump out a field of a host's privdata. Useful for editing
     it.
   * Propellor's output now includes the hostname being provisioned, or
     when provisioning a docker container, the container name."""]]
