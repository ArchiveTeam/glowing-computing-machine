   * Apt.mirror can be used to set the preferred apt mirror of a host,
     overriding the default CDN. This info is used by
     Apt.stdSourcesList and Sbuild.builtFor.
     Thanks, Sean Whitton.
   * Property.Partition: Update kpartx output parser, as its output format
     changed around version 0.6. Both output formats are supported now.
   * Fix bug when using setContainerProps with a chroot that prevented
     properties added to a chroot that way from being seen when propellor
     was running inside the chroot. This affected disk image creation, and
     possibly other things that use chroots."""]]
