propellor 3.0.3 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Remove Propellor.DotDir from the propellor library, as its use of
     Paths\_propellor prevents use of the module out of propellor's tree.
     This module is only needed for the wrapper program anyway, which
     handles --init."""]]
