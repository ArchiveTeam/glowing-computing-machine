propellor 0.8.3 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * The Debian package now includes a single-revision git repository in
     /usr/src/propellor/, and ~/.propellor/ is set up to use this repository as
     its origin remote. This avoids relying on the security of the github
     repository when using the Debian package.
   * The /usr/bin/propellor wrapper will warn when ~/.propellor/ is out of date
     and a newer version is available, after which git merge upstream/master
     can be run to merge it.
   * Included the config.hs symlink to config-simple.hs in the cabal and Debian
     packages."""]]
