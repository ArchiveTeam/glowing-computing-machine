propellor 2.17.0 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Added initial support for FreeBSD.
     Thanks, Evan Cofsky.
   * Added Propellor.Property.ZFS.
     Thanks, Evan Cofsky.
   * Firewall: Reorganized Chain data type. (API change)
     Thanks, Félix Sipma.
   * Firewall: Separated Table and Target (API change)
     Thanks, Félix Sipma.
   * Ssh: change type of listenPort from Int to Port (API change)
     Thanks, Félix Sipma.
   * Firewall: add TCPFlag, Frequency, TCPSyn, ICMPTypeMatch, NatDestination
     Thanks, Félix Sipma.
   * Network: Filter out characters not allowed in interfaces.d files.
     Thanks, Félix Sipma.
   * Apt.upgrade: Run dpkg --configure -a first, to recover from
     interrupted upgrades.
   * Apt: Add safeupgrade.
   * Force ssh, scp, and git commands to be run in the foreground.
     Should fix intermittent hangs of propellor --spin.
   * Avoid repeated re-building on systems such as FreeBSD where building
     re-links the binary even when there are no changes.
   * Locale.available: Run locale-gen, instead of dpkg-reconfigure locales,
     which modified the locale.gen file and sometimes caused the property to
     need to make changes every time.
   * Speed up propellor's build of itself, by asking cabal to only build
     the propellor-config binary and not all the libraries.
   * Tor.named: Fix bug that sometimes caused the property to fail the first
     time, though retrying succeeded."""]]
