propellor 0.5.2 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * A bug that caused propellor to hang when updating a running docker
     container appears to have been fixed. Note that since it affects
     the propellor process that serves as "init" of docker containers,
     they have to be restarted for the fix to take effect.
   * Licence changed from GPL to BSD.
   * A few changes to allow building Propellor on OSX. One user reports
     successfully using it there."""]]
