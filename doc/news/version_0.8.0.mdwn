propellor 0.8.0 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Completely reworked privdata storage. There is now a single file,
     and each host is sent only the privdata that its Properties actually use.
     To transition existing privdata, run propellor against a host and
     watch out for the red failure messages, and run the suggested commands
     to store the privdata using the new storage scheme. You may find
     it useful to run the old version of propellor to extract data from the old
     privdata files during this migration.
     Several properties that use privdata now require a context to be
     specified. If in doubt, you can use anyContext, or
     Context "hostname.example.com"
   * Add --edit to edit a privdata value in $EDITOR.
   * Add --list-fields to list all currently set privdata fields, along with
     the hosts that use them.
   * Fix randomHostKeys property to run openssh-server's postinst in a
     non-failing way.
   * Hostname.sane now cleans up the 127.0.0.1 localhost line in /etc/hosts,
     to avoid eg, apache complaining "Could not reliably determine the
     server's fully qualified domain name"."""]]
