propellor 2.16.0 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Obnam: Only let one backup job run at a time when a host has multiple
     different backup properties, to avoid concurrent jobs fighting over
     scarce resources (particularly memory). Other jobs block on a lock
     file.
   * Removed references to a Debian derivative from code and documentation
     because of an unfortunate trademark use policy.

   * That included changing a data constructor to "Buntish", an API change.
   * Firewall.rule: Now takes a Table parameter. (API change)
   * Firewall: add InIFace/OutIFace Rules, add Source/Destination Rules,
     add CustomTarget, and more improvements.
     Thanks, FÃ©lix Sipma.
   * Ssh.authorizedKey: Fix bug preventing it from working when the
     authorized\_keys file does not yet exist.
   * Removed Ssh.unauthorizedKey and made Ssh.authorizedKey revertable.
     (API change)"""]]
