propellor 3.3.0 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Arch Linux is now supported by Propellor!
     Thanks to Zihao Wang for this port.
   * Added Propellor.Property.Pacman for Arch's package manager.
     Maintained by Zihao Wang.
   * The types of some properties changed; eg from Property DebianLike
     to Property (DebianLike + ArchLinux). Also, DebianLike and Linux
     are no longer type synonyms; propellor now knows that Linux includes
     ArchLinux. This could require updates to code, so is a minor API change.
   * GHC's fileSystemEncoding is used for all String IO, to avoid
     encoding-related crashes in eg, Propellor.Property.File.
   * Add --build option to simply build config.hs.
   * More informative usage message. Thanks, Daniel Brooks
   * Tor.hiddenService' added to support multiple ports.
     Thanks, FÃ©lix Sipma.
   * Apt.noPDiffs added.
     Thanks, Sean Whitton.
   * stack.yaml: Compile with GHC 8.0.1 against lts-7.16.
     Thanks, Andrew Cowie.
   * Added Propellor.Property.File.configFileName and related functions
     to generate good filenames for config directories.
   * Added Apt.suiteAvailablePinned, Apt.pinnedTo.
     Thanks, Sean Whitton.
   * Added File.containsBlock
     Thanks, Sean Whitton."""]]
