propellor 2.5.0 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * cmdProperty' renamed to cmdPropertyEnv to make way for a new,
     more generic cmdProperty' (API change)
   * Add docker image related properties.
     Thanks, Antoine Eiche.
   * Export CommandParam, boolSystem, safeSystem, shellEscape, and
   * createProcess from Propellor.Property.Cmd, so they are available
     for use in constricting your own Properties when using propellor
     as a library.
   * Improve enter-machine scripts for systemd-nspawn containers to unset most
     environment variables.
   * Fix Postfix.satellite bug; the default relayhost was set to the
     domain, not to smtp.domain as documented.
   * Mount /proc inside a chroot before provisioning it, to work around #787227
   * --spin now works when given a short hostname that only resolves to an
     ipv6 address.
   * Added publish property for systemd-spawn containers, for port publishing.
     (Needs systemd version 220.)
   * Added bind and bindRo properties for systemd-spawn containers.
   * Firewall: Port was changed to a newtype, and the Port and PortRange
     constructors of Rules were changed to DPort and DportRange, respectively.
     (API change)
   * Docker: volume and publish accept Bound FilePath and Bound Port,
     respectively. They also continue to accept Strings, for backwards
     compatibility.
   * Docker: Added environment property.
     Thanks Antoine Eiche."""]]
