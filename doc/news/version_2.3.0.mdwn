propellor 2.3.0 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Make propellor resistent to changes to shared libraries, such as libffi,
     which might render the propellor binary unable to run. This is dealt with
     by checking the binary both when running propellor on a remote host,
     and by Cron.runPropellor. If the binary doesn't work, it will be rebuilt.
   * Note that since a new switch had to be added to allow testing the binary,
     upgrading to this version will cause a rebuild from scratch of propellor.
   * Added hasLoginShell and shellEnabled.
   * debCdn changed to new httpredir.debian.org official replacement for
     http.debian.net.
   * API change: Added User and Group newtypes, and Properties that
     used to use the type UserName = String were changed to use them."""]]
