[[!toggleable text="""
   * Propellor no longer supports Debian wheezy (oldstable).
   * Git.bareRepo: Fix bug in calls to userScriptProperty.
     Thanks, Jelmer Vernooij.
   * Removed Obnam.latestVersion which was only needed for Debian wheezy
     backport.
   * Merged Utility changes from git-annex.
   * Switched from MonadCatchIO-transformers to the newer transformers and
     exceptions libraries.
   * Ensure build deps are installed before building propellor in --spin
     and cron job, even if propellor was already built before, to deal with
     upgrades that add new dependencies."""]]
