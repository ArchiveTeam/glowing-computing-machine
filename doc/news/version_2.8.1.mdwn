propellor 2.8.1 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Guard against power loss etc when building propellor, by updating
     the executable atomically.
   * Added Logcheck module, contributed by Jelmer Vernooij.
   * Added Kerberos module, contributed by Jelmer Vernooij.
   * Privdata that uses HostContext inside a container will now have the
     name of the container as its context, rather than the name of
     the host(s) where the container is used. This allows eg, having different
     passwords for a user in different containers. Note that previously,
     propellor would prompt using the container name as the context, but
     not actually use privdata using that context; so this is a bug fix.
   * Fix --add-key to not fail committing when no privdata file exists yet."""]]
