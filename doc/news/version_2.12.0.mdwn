propellor 2.12.0 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * The DiskImage module can now make bootable images using grub.
   * Add a ChrootTarball chroot type, for using pre-built tarballs
     as chroots. Thanks, Ben Boeckel.
   * HostName: Improve domain extraction code.
   * Added Mount.fstabbed property to generate /etc/fstab to replicate
     current mounts.
   * HostName: Improve domain extraction code.
   * Add File.basedOn. Thanks, Per Olofsson.
   * Changed how the operating system is provided to Chroot (API change).
     Where before debootstrapped and bootstrapped took a System parameter,
     the os property should now be added to the Chroot.
   * Follow-on change to Systemd.container, which now takes a System parameter.
   * Generalized Property.check so it can be used with Propellor actions as
     well as IO actions.
   * Hostname.sane and Hostname.setTo can now safely be used as a property
     of a chroot, and won't affect the hostname of the host system."""]]
