propellor 2.7.0 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Ssh.permitRootLogin type changed to allow configuring WithoutPassword
     and ForcedCommandsOnly (API change)
   * setSshdConfig type changed, and setSshdConfigBool added with old type.
   * Fix a bug in shim generation code for docker and chroots, that
     sometimes prevented deployment of docker containers.
   * Added onChangeFlagOnFail which is often a safer alternative to
     onChange.
     Thanks, Antoine Eiche.
   * Work around broken git pull option parser in git 2.5.0,
     which broke use of --upload-pack to send a git push when running
     propellor --spin."""]]
