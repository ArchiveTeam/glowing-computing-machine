[[!toggleable text="""
 * [ Sean Whitton ]
   * Using ccache with Sbuild.built &amp; Sbuild.builtFor is now toggleable: these
     properties now take a parameter of type Sbuild.UseCcache.  (API Change)
   * Sbuild.piupartsConf: no longer takes an Apt.Url. (API Change)
   * Sbuild.piupartsConf &amp; Sbuild.piupartsConfFor: does nothing if corresponding
     schroot not built.
     Previously, these properties built the schroot if it was missing.
   * Sbuild.built &amp; Sbuild.piupartsConf: add an additional alias to sid chroots.
     This is for compatibility with `dgit sbuild`.
   * Further improvements to Sbuild.hs haddock.
 * [ Joey Hess ]
   * Tor.hiddenService: Converted port parameter from Int to Port. (API change)
   * Tor.hiddenServiceAvailable: The hidden service hostname file may not
     be available immedaitely after configuring tor; avoid ugly error in
     this case."""]]
