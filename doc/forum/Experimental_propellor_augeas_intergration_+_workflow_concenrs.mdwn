I'm not experienced haskeller, but I've started to work on augeas property for propellor. I've created a separate repo for it: https://github.com/paluh/propellor-augeas. I will try to rewrite some existing properties on top of this and add some new. It is in a really early stage, but it works.

I think that it will be a lot easier to work on propellor core properties and features, if it will be separated lib without any "spinning" abilities. Currently when I'm trying to read your or my commit history there is a lot of "propellor spin" commits without any sensible comment. In addition it will be a lot harder to merge my changes to your repo - I can't just send you pull request. What do you think about extracting pure library from existing project?
