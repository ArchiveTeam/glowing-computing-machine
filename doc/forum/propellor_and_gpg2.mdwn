I had a problem similar to [[Key sign problem]]. Maybe in that case the fix was easy, just supplying the secret key.

In my case this was a fresh install into a new Debian/sid system (so gpg2 is the default) and the failure happened during the propellor --init following the directions in the quick start at <https://propellor.branchable.com/>. During the --init I selected to create a gpg key. The message, after finally getting enough entropy and creating the gpg key was:
    error:gpg failed to sign the data
    fatal: failed to write commit object

So it was frustrating that propellor didn't work out of the box and there were no hints what was wrong with signing commits in git (the error above is from git and doing git commit -S was enough to reproduce it).

But I persevered and happened across a sort of solution. I'm sharing it here because searching for git commit failures with gpgp2 wasn't very helpful.

The issue has to do with prompting for a passphrase in gpg2. If the agent is running and $GPG_TTY is set correctly you get a prompt and things will work. If the agent is not running then gpg doesn't prompt for the passphrase and the commit fails as above. Luckily I was able to try this on a Mac, which gave an agent ioctl error, which got me to this answer.

Initially I was trying propellor before I installed a desktop so I didn't have the gpg agent. I'm not sure how to work around this issue without the agent but I'll keep looking for git + gpg2 help.
