* Need a way to run an action when a property changes, but only
  run it once for the whole. For example, may want to restart apache,
  but only once despite many config changes being made to satisfy
  properties. onChange is a poor substitute.
* Apt upgrade does not avoid apt-listchanges and debconf prompts.
* I often seem to want to be able to combine Properties monadically.
