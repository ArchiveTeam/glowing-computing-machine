* Need a way to run an action when a property changes, but only
  run it once for the whole. For example, may want to restart apache,
  but only once despite many config changes being made to satisfy
  properties. onChange is a poor substitute.
* --spin needs 4 ssh connections when bootstrapping a new host
  that does not have the git repo yet. Should be possible to get that
  down to 1.
* Currently only Debian and derivatives are supported by most Properties.
  One way to improve that would be to parameterize Properties with a
  Distribution witness.
* Display of docker container properties is a bit wonky. It always
  says they are unchanged even when they changed and triggered a
  reprovision.
* Should properties be a tree rather than a list?
* Only make docker garbage collection run once a day or something
  to avoid GC after a temp fail.
